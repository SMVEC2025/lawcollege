                    <h3> Dr. G. MOHAMED YASSIN</h3>
                    <p>As Dean, it is my privilege to lead a department that plays such a vital role in shaping the future of food security, sustainable farming, and rural development. Agriculture today is more than just cultivationâ€”it is a science, a technology, and a commitment to feeding the world responsibly. Our department is dedicated to providing students with a strong academic foundation, practical exposure, and innovative research opportunities to help them grow into capable, ethical, and forward-thinking agricultural professionals.

                        We believe in nurturing minds that will not only understand the soil but also care for the environment, uplift rural communities, and embrace agri-entrepreneurship. Through a blend of classroom learning, field-based training, and community outreach, our students are prepared to meet modern agricultural challenges with confidence. I warmly welcome you to be part of this mission and explore the many opportunities our department has to offer.</p>
